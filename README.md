# "Digital Business Card" for Learn React for free course by *Bob Ziroll*

- Although the original idea was to do the project on the **Scrimba** website, I decided to set up a React project with create-react-app in order to start working with a more real enviroment (also, this makes a great addition to my portfolio!).

- The objective was to match the following digital business card: https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A1

- This mini project was made in order to practice basic **React** concepts, which I found pretty intuitive to grasp thanks to my past use of *Webpack* and modules in **The Odin Project's** Vanilla Javascript course. The most difficult part was to match de CSS formatting, though *Figma* proved quite an interesting
tool in order to help get done with the visual aspect in a quick way.
